# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning
This repository consolidates household electric power consumption data into a *** SQL Server data warehouse and trains a deep learning model (e.g.,) to forecast electricity demand for the next 1 hour ***. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (using MSE, RMSE), and orchestration via Apache Airflow. Focused on Individual Household Electric Power Consumption data from 2006â€“2010, resampled at 15-minute intervals, this project supports grid optimization through accurate demand forecasting using deep learning. Clear documentation is provided for stakeholders.
